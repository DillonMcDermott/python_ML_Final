Title:
Car Price Prediction Model

  ​​This project focuses on developing a machine learning model to predict car prices
based on key vehicle attributes. Implemented in Python, the model will be trained
using a car pricing dataset from Kaggle, which includes data points such as price,
production year, engine size, mileage, and the number of previous owners. By using
machine learning algorithms such as linear regression and decision trees, the model
searches for patterns in historical pricing data. This will allow it to make
predictions on a vehicle's future price. The primary goal of this project is to
provide a reliable tool for individuals and businesses selling used cars. Car owners
looking to sell their vehicles can use this model to estimate a price, while
dealerships can use it to make pricing strategies. Ultimately, this project aims to
streamline the car evaluation process, reducing reliance on manual assessments and
improving pricing transparency for buyers and sellers.
