Title:
Car Price Prediction Model


Abstract:
This project aims to develop a machine learning model for predicting car prices.
The model will be written in Python and trained using a car pricing dataset from Kaggle.
Some examples of data points in this dataset are: price, production year, engine size, mileage, and owner count.
Once trained this model can be used by car owners looking to sell their car or dealerships pricing a used car.
