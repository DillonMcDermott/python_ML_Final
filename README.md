## Instructions to Run
1. Install dependencies and libraries if applicable (pandas, numpy, sklearn, etc.).
2. Navigate to the folder newest_model.
2. First build/run the file car_price.py with the python command python3 car_price.py in order to greate the saved model the terminal__cli uses. (Must be done since saved models were too large for github)
3. Build/run terminal_cli.py in order to use the program with command python3 terminal_cli.py.

## Self Grade and Justification
Based on self Evaluation and judges scores our project has an average grade of 44/60. This grade feels accurate because we followed parameters of making a machine model and clearly explained the goals and what the results of said model were. Our dip in score is mainly the result of we were playing it safe and not challenging ourselves like some other projects. Overall we didn't seek to innovate much and our demonstration of a program using our model wasn't very ambitious. The cleanup of data and feature engineering to improve results was effective and demonstrates and understandign of machine learning concepts so this project still is worthy of a passing grade.
